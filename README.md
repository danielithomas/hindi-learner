# Hindi Learner

A Claude project "back end" to store lessons, phrases and words so I can learn Hindi.

## Why?

I am a native English speaker (though as an Aussie, some might find this debatable...). I have been learning Hindi for two years using Duolingo, but I am *not* conversational. Even with access to native Hindi speakers I am struggling: I _hear_ the words and recognise most, but for a lot of them I _know_ the word but forget the meaning. 

I decided to see if I could create a Claude Project that would help me learn Hindi, but I want to take it a step further: Whenever I learn a word or Phrase, I want to record it for later and use this as a quick reference to remind me that I have learned a word. 

This will _not_ replace conversational Hindi, but I really want to accelerate my learning. This will either succeed, or not. However, I'm want to add this into my arsenal to become conversational.

I have called my project Hindi Guru and this is a link to the prompt I am using.

## Notes

I've made a lot of assumptions. One of the few benefits of Duolingo was that I can actually read and sound out most words written in "Devanagari". However I have this script and the Romanised version (Hindi written in latin characters).

## Lessons

Every time I have a question, it becomes a "lesson". Here are my lessons:
